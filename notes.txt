14. Proxy Server: is a server that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server. 
    When a client requests a resource from a server, the proxy server receives the request and forwards it to the server. 
    The server then sends a response back to the proxy server, which forwards the response to the client.
    Proxy servers can be configured to use a variety of protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and SMTP.
    Proxy servers can be used to filter traffic based on a variety of criteria, such as IP address, URL, and content.
    Proxy servers can be used to hide a client's IP address, which can be useful for privacy or bypassing censorship.
    Proxy servers can be used to load balance traffic across multiple servers, which can improve performance.
    Proxy servers can be used for a variety of purposes, including:
        Caching: Proxy servers can cache frequently accessed resources, which can improve performance.
        Security: Proxy servers can be used to filter traffic and protect clients from malicious websites.
        Anonymity: Proxy servers can be used to hide a client's IP address, which can be useful for privacy or bypassing censorship.
        Load balancing: Proxy servers can be used to distribute traffic across multiple servers, which can improve performance.
    a. Forward proxy server: are used to connect clients to servers.
    b. Reverse proxy server: Reverse proxy servers are used to connect servers to clients.
